  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Polycythemia vera is characterized by an increased hematocrit due to overproduction of red blood cells.",
    "tile_1": "The majority of patients with Polycythemia Vera have a mutation in the JAK2 gene (V617F most common).",
    "tile_2": "Post-bath pruritus is a common symptom of Polycythemia Vera, likely due to increased histamine release from basophils.",
    "tile_3": "Erythromelalgia, or burning, painful erythema of the hands and feet, is a common symptom of Polycythemia Vera.",
    "tile_4": "Splenomegaly is frequently present in Polycythemia Vera due to extramedullary hematopoiesis.",
    "tile_5": "In Polycythemia Vera, erythropoietin (EPO) levels are typically low or normal due to feedback inhibition from increased red cell mass.",
    "tile_6": "Patients with Polycythemia Vera are at an increased risk of thrombotic events.",
    "tile_7": "Bone marrow in Polycythemia Vera is hypercellular due to increased production of all three cell lines (panmyelosis).",
    "tile_8": "Absence of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) helps to exclude chronic myeloid leukemia, which can present similarly to Polycythemia Vera."
