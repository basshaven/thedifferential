  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Young age (8 years old) is classic for minimal change disease, which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.",
    "tile_1": "Facial swelling, especially periorbital edema, is often the first sign parents notice in pediatric nephrotic syndrome.",
    "tile_2": "Massive proteinuria (4+ on dipstick) is the hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, defined as >3.5g protein per day.",
    "tile_3": "Severe hypoalbuminemia (<2.5 g/dL) occurs due to urinary protein losses and contributes to edema formation.",
    "tile_4": "Hypercholesterolemia is part of the classic nephrotic syndrome tetrad, caused by increased hepatic lipoprotein synthesis.",
    "tile_5": "Light microscopy shows normal-appearing glomeruli in minimal change disease, distinguishing it from other causes.",
    "tile_6": "Electron microscopy reveals podocyte foot process effacement (fusion), the pathognomonic finding in minimal change disease.",
    "tile_7": "Excellent response to corticosteroids (>90% in children) is characteristic and helps confirm the diagnosis.",
    "tile_8": "Absence of immune deposits on immunofluorescence distinguishes minimal change disease from immune-mediated glomerulonephritis."
