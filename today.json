    "tile_0": "Sheehan's syndrome typically affects women who have had a severe obstetric hemorrhage.",
    "tile_1": "Severe blood loss during childbirth can lead to ischemia and necrosis of the pituitary gland.",
    "tile_2": "Sheehan's syndrome can cause failure of lactation postpartum due to pituitary necrosis affecting prolactin production.",
    "tile_3": "The condition can cause fatigue and weight gain due to deficiencies in pituitary hormones, especially thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).",
    "tile_4": "Loss of pubic and axillary hair can occur due to decreased secretion of sex hormones.",
    "tile_5": "Low plasma ACTH level indicates adrenal insufficiency, which is a common feature in Sheehan's syndrome.",
    "tile_6": "Low serum TSH levels indicate pituitary (secondary) hypothyroidism which is a common feature in Sheehan's syndrome.",
    "tile_7": "MRI showing empty sella turcica is a typical finding in Sheehan's syndrome due to postpartum pituitary gland necrosis.",
    "tile_8": "Hyponatremia can occur due to the lack of pituitary production of ACTH leading to adrenal insufficiency and decreased cortisol."
