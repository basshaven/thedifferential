  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Bulbar palsy refers to impairment of function of the cranial nerves IX, X, XI, XII, which occurs in ALS leading to dysphagia, dysarthria, and facial weakness.",
    "tile_1": "Muscle weakness, often starting in one area, is a key symptom of ALS as motor neurons degenerate and die.",
    "tile_2": "Fasciculations, or muscle twitching, is a common symptom in ALS due to motor neuron hyperexcitability.",
    "tile_3": "ALS is characterized by progressive worsening of symptoms, which helps to distinguish it from other conditions.",
    "tile_4": "The presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs is consistent with ALS, as it affects both types of motor neurons.",
    "tile_5": "No sensory loss is a key feature helping to distinguish ALS from other similar conditions, as sensory neurons are not affected in ALS.",
    "tile_6": "While cognitive function is normal in most ALS patients, some may develop cognitive and behavioral changes. However, the primary feature of ALS is motor neuron degeneration.",
    "tile_7": "Electromyography showing signs of denervation is used in the diagnosis of ALS to confirm the presence of motor neuron damage.",
    "tile_8": "Exclusion of other diseases that mimic ALS is critical in the diagnostic process, as there is no definitive test for ALS."
