  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Hyperreflexia is a common sign of serotonin syndrome, caused by excess serotonin in the CNS.",
    "tile_1": "Serotonin syndrome is often caused by the use of drugs that increase the level of serotonin, such as SSRIs.",
    "tile_2": "Clonus (rapid involuntary muscle contraction and relaxation) is a characteristic feature of serotonin syndrome.",
    "tile_3": "Excessive sweating can occur in serotonin syndrome due to overactivation of the autonomic nervous system.",
    "tile_4": "Tremors can be a common sign of serotonin syndrome, reflecting CNS excitation.",
    "tile_5": "Adding tramadol (which has serotonergic activity) to an SSRI regimen can increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.",
    "tile_6": "Dilated pupils (mydriasis) can occur in serotonin syndrome due to increased sympathetic activity.",
    "tile_7": "Tachycardia is a common sign of serotonin syndrome, reflecting autonomic nervous system overactivity.",
    "tile_8": "High body temperature (hyperthermia) can occur in severe cases of serotonin syndrome, due to increased muscle activity."
