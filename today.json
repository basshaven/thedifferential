It is characterized by an increase in the number of red cells in the blood. It's a condition that's not common, not too rare, and diagnostically challenging, making it a good learning opportunity.",

    "tile_0": "Polycythemia Vera is characterized by an increase in the number of red cells in the blood, leading to elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit.",
    "tile_1": "The majority of patients with Polycythemia Vera have a mutation in the JAK2 gene.",
    "tile_2": "Plethora, or ruddy complexion, is a common physical finding in Polycythemia Vera due to increased red blood cells.",
    "tile_3": "Pruritus, especially after a hot bath, is a common symptom in Polycythemia Vera due to increased basophils.",
    "tile_4": "Splenomegaly is often seen in Polycythemia Vera, due to extramedullary hematopoiesis.",
    "tile_5": "Thrombosis is a major complication of Polycythemia Vera due to increased blood viscosity and platelet activation.",
    "tile_6": "In Polycythemia Vera, erythropoietin (EPO) levels are typically low or normal due to feedback inhibition from increased red blood cell mass.",
    "tile_7": "Leukocytosis is often seen in Polycythemia Vera, due to proliferation of all three myeloid cell lines.",
    "tile_8": "Thrombocytosis is often seen in Polycythemia Vera, due to proliferation of all three myeloid cell lines."
