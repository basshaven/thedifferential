  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Hyperpigmentation in Addison's disease is due to high ACTH levels which also stimulate melanin production.",
    "tile_1": "Postural hypotension results from aldosterone deficiency leading to sodium loss, volume depletion, and hypotension.",
    "tile_2": "Hypoglycemia in Addison's disease occurs due to cortisol deficiency, impairing gluconeogenesis.",
    "tile_3": "Fatigue is a common symptom of Addison's disease due to the lack of cortisol.",
    "tile_4": "Hyponatremia is caused by aldosterone deficiency leading to impaired renal sodium reabsorption.",
    "tile_5": "Hyperkalemia occurs because of decreased aldosterone, leading to reduced renal potassium excretion.",
    "tile_6": "Low cortisol level is the main hormonal feature of Addison's disease due to adrenal insufficiency.",
    "tile_7": "High ACTH level is due to lack of negative feedback inhibition by cortisol.",
    "tile_8": "Absence or atrophy of adrenal glands on CT scan can be seen in Addison's disease."
