  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms in MS, affecting about 80% of people. It can significantly interfere with a person's ability to function at home and work, and may be the most prominent symptom in a person who otherwise has minimal activity limitations.",
    "tile_1": "Vision problems, such as optic neuritis causing pain and temporary vision loss, are often the first symptom of MS. They occur when MS affects the optic nerve.",
    "tile_2": "Lhermitte's sign is a brief, stabbing, electric-shock-like sensation that runs from the back of the head down the spine, brought on by bending the neck forward. It's present in over a third of people with MS.",
    "tile_3": "Spasticity, or stiffness and involuntary muscle spasms, is a common symptom of MS. It's often an early symptom, but can be overlooked as it gradually develops over time.",
    "tile_4": "Bowel dysfunctions like constipation and loss of bowel control can occur in MS due to disrupted signals between the brain and the bowel.",
    "tile_5": "MRI brain lesions are a key diagnostic tool for MS. These lesions are areas of inflammation in the brain where the myelin, the protective coating of nerve fibers, has been damaged by the disease.",
    "tile_6": "Oligoclonal bands, or unique proteins, are found in the cerebrospinal fluid of about 85-90% of people with MS. They indicate inflammation and are a sign of immune system activity.",
    "tile_7": "Relapsing-remitting MS, characterized by periods of new symptoms or relapses followed by periods of recovery, is the most common form of the disease.",
    "tile_8": "Charcot's Neurologic triad of nystagmus, intention tremor, and telegraphic speech is classic in MS, but it's a late finding and many patients won't exhibit the full triad."
