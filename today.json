    "tile_1": "The classic presentation of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome is rapid-onset muscle weakness starting in the legs.",
    "tile_2": "A hallmark of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome is absent or decreased deep tendon reflexes.",
    "tile_3": "Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome typically presents with an ascending pattern of paralysis.",
    "tile_4": "Respiratory distress can occur in severe cases due to paralysis affecting the diaphragm and chest muscles.",
    "tile_5": "Many cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome are preceded by an infection, commonly Campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium that can cause gastrointestinal illness.",
    "tile_6": "A distinguishing feature of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome is high protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).",
    "tile_7": "Despite the high protein level, the cell count in the CSF remains normal - a phenomenon known as albuminocytologic dissociation.",
    "tile_8": "Nerve conduction studies in Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome often show slowed velocities, indicating demyelination of the peripheral nerves."
