  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Aortic dissection is more common in males and in the 6th decade of life.",
    "tile_1": "Sudden, severe chest pain is a classic symptom of aortic dissection, often described as 'tearing' or 'ripping'.",
    "tile_2": "Hypertension can be a risk factor for aortic dissection and may also be a result of the condition.",
    "tile_3": "A pulse deficit (different pulse strength in the arms) can occur due to impaired blood flow to one arm.",
    "tile_4": "A diastolic murmur may be heard due to aortic regurgitation secondary to the dissection.",
    "tile_5": "A widened mediastinum on X-ray is a classic radiological finding in aortic dissection.",
    "tile_6": "D-dimer can be elevated in aortic dissection, although it is not specific and can be raised in other conditions such as pulmonary embolism.",
    "tile_7": "The presence of an intimal flap on CT is pathognomonic for aortic dissection.",
    "tile_8": "Unequal blood pressure in the limbs can occur in aortic dissection due to impaired blood flow."
