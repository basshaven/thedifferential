  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Bone pain in Multiple Myeloma is caused by the proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow, leading to bone destruction and pain.",
    "tile_1": "Monoclonal spike, or M-spike, is a peak seen on serum protein electrophoresis, indicating a large amount of a single type of immunoglobulin - a hallmark of Multiple Myeloma.",
    "tile_2": "Hypercalcemia in Multiple Myeloma occurs due to increased bone resorption from the overproduction of osteoclast-stimulating factors by the myeloma cells.",
    "tile_3": "Renal insufficiency in Multiple Myeloma is caused by the toxic effects of excess light chains on the kidneys, leading to renal impairment.",
    "tile_4": "Anemia in Multiple Myeloma is caused by the replacement of normal bone marrow by malignant plasma cells, leading to decreased erythropoiesis.",
    "tile_5": "Bence Jones protein, a type of light chain, is often found in the urine of patients with Multiple Myeloma.",
    "tile_6": "Plasmacytosis, or an increased number of plasma cells, is seen in the bone marrow of patients with Multiple Myeloma.",
    "tile_7": "Lytic bone lesions are common in Multiple Myeloma due to increased osteoclast activity stimulated by the myeloma cells.",
    "tile_8": "\u03b22-microglobulin is a component of MHC class I molecules, and its levels are often elevated in the serum of patients with Multiple Myeloma, reflecting a high tumor burden."
