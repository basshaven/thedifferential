    "tile_1": "Low cortisol is a key feature of Addison's disease, due to adrenal gland damage.",
    "tile_2": "Salt craving occurs due to aldosterone deficiency leading to sodium loss.",
    "tile_3": "Orthostatic hypotension is seen due to volume depletion from aldosterone deficiency.",
    "tile_4": "High ACTH is due to loss of negative feedback from cortisol in the pituitary.",
    "tile_5": "Hypoglycemia can occur in Addison's disease due to lack of cortisol's gluconeogenic activity.",
    "tile_6": "Hyperkalemia results from aldosterone deficiency causing decreased renal potassium excretion.",
    "tile_7": "Low aldosterone occurs due to adrenal gland damage, leading to sodium loss and hyperkalemia.",
    "tile_8": "Hyponatremia can occur due to both aldosterone deficiency causing sodium loss, and ADH secretion in response to hypotension."
