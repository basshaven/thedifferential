    "tile_1": "The condition occurs after a severe postpartum hemorrhage, which leads to necrosis of the pituitary gland.",

    "tile_3": "Menstrual irregularity is another symptom caused by decreased secretion of pituitary hormones.",
    "tile_4": "Low blood pressure is a symptom of adrenal insufficiency, a condition that can accompany Sheehan's syndrome.",
    "tile_5": "Delayed lactation postpartum is seen due to lack of prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland.",
    "tile_6": "Hypoglycemia can result from adrenal insufficiency.",
    "tile_7": "Low levels of serum cortisol are indicative of adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary dysfunction.",
    "tile_8": "MRI imaging often shows shrinkage of the pituitary gland, supporting the diagnosis of Sheehan's syndrome."
