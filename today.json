    "tile_0": "Velcro crackles on auscultation are a characteristic finding in patients with IPF, resembling the sound made when separating a Velcro fastener.",
    "tile_1": "Clubbing, a bulbous enlargement of the ends of fingers or toes, is often seen in IPF and signifies advanced disease.",
    "tile_2": "Dry cough is a common symptom of IPF and is often one of the first symptoms.",
    "tile_3": "Dyspnea, particularly on exertion, is a common symptom of IPF and usually progressive.",
    "tile_4": "IPF, by definition, is a form of ILD that occurs without a known cause.",
    "tile_5": "A usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution CT scan is a classic radiologic finding in IPF.",
    "tile_6": "Subpleural fibrosis, or thickening of tissue beneath the pleural surface, is a typical finding in IPF.",
    "tile_7": "Honeycombing on CT, which refers to the appearance of clustered cystic air spaces, is a classic but late feature of IPF.",
    "tile_8": "Exclusion of other ILDs is a part of the diagnostic criteria for IPF."
