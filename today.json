  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Apical ballooning is a classic echocardiographic finding in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, where the left ventricle takes a distinctive shape similar to a 'takotsubo', a Japanese octopus trap.",
    "tile_1": "Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy is often precipitated by a severe stressor, either physical or emotional, hence the name 'stress cardiomyopathy'.",
    "tile_2": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction, with recovery usually within weeks.",
    "tile_3": "The condition is more common in postmenopausal women, though the reason for this is unclear.",
    "tile_4": "Patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy often present with symptoms similar to a heart attack, including chest pain and shortness of breath.",
    "tile_5": "Despite the similar presentation to a heart attack, coronary angiography in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically shows normal or near-normal coronary arteries.",
    "tile_6": "Troponin levels are typically elevated in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, further mimicking an acute myocardial infarction.",
    "tile_7": "ECG changes in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can mimic those seen in acute coronary syndrome, including ST segment elevation.",
    "tile_8": "Unlike most forms of cardiomyopathy, the left ventricular dysfunction in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is usually reversible, with complete recovery often occurring within weeks."
