  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Chronic diarrhea is a common symptom in celiac disease as the body's immune response to gluten damages the small intestine, impairing nutrient absorption. However, it's a nonspecific symptom that could suggest many conditions.",
    "tile_1": "Weight loss can occur in celiac disease due to malabsorption of nutrients caused by intestinal damage. However, weight loss is a nonspecific symptom seen in many gastrointestinal conditions.",
    "tile_2": "Iron-deficiency anemia can be a presenting symptom of celiac disease. The malabsorption in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, where iron is primarily absorbed, leads to this type of anemia.",
    "tile_3": "Aphthous stomatitis, or recurrent mouth ulcers, can be associated with celiac disease. Although not specific, it's a clue towards a systemic cause for the patient's symptoms.",
    "tile_4": "Dermatitis herpetiformis is a skin manifestation of celiac disease, characterized by intensely itchy vesicles and blisters. It's not common, but highly suggestive of celiac disease when present.",
    "tile_5": "Celiac disease has a strong genetic component. Almost all patients with celiac disease express HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 haplotypes. However, these are also common in the general population.",
    "tile_6": "Anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) IgA antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease. This is a critical diagnostic test, but must be interpreted in the overall clinical context.",
    "tile_7": "Villous atrophy on small bowel biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing celiac disease. The immune reaction in celiac disease results in inflammation and damage to the intestinal villi, impairing nutrient absorption.",
    "tile_8": "A key feature of celiac disease is that symptoms improve on a gluten-free diet. This is a critical diagnostic clue, especially in the setting of other supportive findings."
