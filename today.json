    "tile_3": "Ultrasound can reveal a pleural line or 'barcode sign' indicating pneumothorax.",
    "tile_4": "Jugular venous distension (JVD) can occur due to impaired venous return to the heart.",
    "tile_5": "Hyperresonance on percussion is found on the affected side due to air-filled pleural space.",
    "tile_6": "Tachycardia can occur as a compensatory response to hypoxia and hypotension.",
    "tile_7": "Chest pain, often sudden and severe, is a common symptom of pneumothorax.",
    "tile_8": "Dyspnea or difficulty breathing is a common symptom due to decreased lung capacity on the affected side."
