    "tile_2": "Pruritus, especially after a warm bath, is a common symptom of Polycythemia Vera due to increased histamine release by basophils.",
    "tile_3": "Erythromelalgia, or burning pain and redness of the extremities, is a common symptom in Polycythemia Vera due to increased blood viscosity and platelet activation.",
    "tile_4": "Splenomegaly occurs in Polycythemia Vera due to extramedullary hematopoiesis.",
    "tile_5": "Low erythropoietin (EPO) levels help distinguish primary from secondary polycythemia. In Polycythemia Vera, EPO levels are low or normal despite high red cell mass.",
    "tile_6": "Thrombosis history is common in Polycythemia Vera due to increased blood viscosity and platelet activation.",
    "tile_7": "Hypercellular bone marrow with panmyelosis is seen in Polycythemia Vera.",
    "tile_8": "Increased neutrophils and other granulocytes are seen in Polycythemia Vera due to uncontrolled proliferation of all three myeloid cell lines."
