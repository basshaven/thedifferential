It provides an excellent teaching case for understanding complement-mediated diseases and the importance of flow cytometry in diagnosing hematological disorders.",

  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "In PNH, there is intravascular hemolysis, leading to a hemolytic anemia. This is a characteristic feature of the disease.",
    "tile_1": "Patients with PNH often report dark-colored urine upon waking, due to overnight hemolysis.",
    "tile_2": "PNH can cause a decrease in all types of blood cells (pancytopenia) due to bone marrow failure.",
    "tile_3": "PNH is associated with thrombosis in unusual sites, such as hepatic, abdominal, cerebral veins.",
    "tile_4": "Smooth muscle dystonias, such as esophageal spasm and erectile dysfunction, are associated with PNH.",
    "tile_5": "Deficiency of CD55/CD59 on red blood cells leads to increased complement-mediated lysis, characteristic of PNH.",
    "tile_6": "Raised LDH is a marker of increased cell turnover, seen in conditions like PNH with ongoing hemolysis.",
    "tile_7": "Flow cytometry is a key diagnostic test for PNH, showing a population of cells lacking GPI-linked proteins.",
    "tile_8": "Ham's test (acidified serum lysis test) is a screening test for PNH, but has largely been replaced by flow cytometry."
