  "explanations": {
    "tile_0": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the presence of both upper and lower motor neuron signs.",
    "tile_1": "Progressive weakness is a key feature of ALS, typically starting in one limb and spreading to other parts of the body.",
    "tile_2": "Bulbar symptoms such as dysarthria and dysphagia occur as the disease progresses.",
    "tile_3": "In ALS, sensory examination is usually normal as sensory neurons are typically not affected.",
    "tile_4": "ALS does not directly affect bowel or bladder function.",
    "tile_5": "Electromyography (EMG) typically shows evidence of widespread denervation which is a diagnostic clue for ALS.",
    "tile_6": "While cognitive impairment can occur in some patients with ALS, it is not a universal feature and its absence does not rule out the disease.",
    "tile_7": "In ALS, MRI of the brain and spine is usually normal, helping to exclude other diagnoses.",
    "tile_8": "ALS is a diagnosis of exclusion; other diseases must be ruled out before confirming the diagnosis."
