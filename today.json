    "tile_0": "Serotonin Syndrome is commonly associated with the recent introduction or increase in dose of a serotonergic medication, such as an SSRI.",
    "tile_1": "Hyperreflexia and clonus are classic neuromuscular features of Serotonin Syndrome.",
    "tile_2": "Restlessness and agitation are common mental state changes in Serotonin Syndrome.",
    "tile_3": "Autonomic dysregulation occurs in Serotonin Syndrome, represented by symptoms such as tachycardia, labile blood pressure, and hyperthermia.",
    "tile_4": "Neuromuscular hyperactivity, including tremor, muscle rigidity, and spontaneous clonus, is a key feature of Serotonin Syndrome.",
    "tile_5": "Serotonin Syndrome can be precipitated by a variety of drugs that increase serotonin concentrations in the brain.",
    "tile_6": "Hyperthermia and diaphoresis are manifestations of the autonomic instability seen in Serotonin Syndrome.",
    "tile_7": "The absence of a recent history of neuroleptic use helps differentiate Serotonin Syndrome from Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome, a key differential diagnosis.",
    "tile_8": "The resolution of symptoms after the discontinuation of the causative drug is a key diagnostic feature of Serotonin Syndrome."
