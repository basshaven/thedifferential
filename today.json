It is a rare but potentially fatal genetic heart condition that can cause ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death, making it an important diagnosis to consider in young patients with syncope or family history of sudden death. It is characterized by a distinct ECG pattern and unexplained syncope, making it a good learning opportunity.",

    "tile_4": "Brugada Syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause sudden cardiac death, so a family history of sudden death is a clue.",
    "tile_5": "Unlike Long QT Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome presents with a normal QT interval.",
    "tile_6": "Brugada Syndrome occurs without structural heart disease, differentiating it from conditions like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
    "tile_7": "Stress tests are typically negative in Brugada Syndrome as it is not caused by myocardial ischemia.",
    "tile_8": "Brugada Syndrome is a type of sodium channelopathy, affecting the ion channels in heart cells and leading to arrhythmias."
