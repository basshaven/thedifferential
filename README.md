### **Core Gameplay**
- **3x3 tile grid** organized by difficulty columns (Easy | Medium | Hard)
- **Strategic scoring**: Easy tiles -3 points, Medium -2, Hard -1 
- **Key Strategy**: Easy tiles cost MORE but contain the most pathognomonic/characteristic clues
- **Optimal Play**: Flip easy tiles first to get maximum diagnostic value per point
- **Smart answer matching**: Accepts medical variations, typos, abbreviations, synonyms
- **Base score**: 25 points, range 0-100
- **3 attempts** with guess bonuses: 1st +25, 2nd +10, 3rd +0
- **Wrong guess penalty**: -5 points each

### **Visual Experience**

### **üß† Smart Answer System**
- **Multiple acceptable answers**: "Legionella" = "Legionnaire's disease" = "Legionella pneumonia"
- **Typo tolerance**: "legionela" ‚Üí "legionella" (minor spelling errors accepted)
- **Punctuation flexible**: "Sheehan's syndrome" = "Sheehan syndrome" = "sheehans syndrome"
- **Medical abbreviations**: "MI" = "Myocardial infarction" = "Heart attack"

   python generate_puzzle.py
   ```

2. **Review the generated puzzle** (shows discipline, answer, tiles, and explanations)

3. **Approve or regenerate** until you're satisfied

4. **Push to live site:** (script provides exact commands - no spoilers!)
   ```bash
   git add today.json
   git commit -m "Daily puzzle: [discipline] - [date]"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update

6. **Verify live:** https://basshaven.github.io/thedifferential

### **‚öôÔ∏è One-Time Setup for Daily Updates**

If this is your first time:

1. **Install Python requirements:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Add your OpenAI API key:**
   ```bash
   echo "sk-your-actual-openai-key" > openai_key.txt
   ```

3. **Test generation:**
   ```bash
   python generate_puzzle.py
   ```

### **üéõÔ∏è Advanced Generation Options**

```bash
# Skip review and auto-save
python generate_puzzle.py --no-review

# Multiple attempts if generation fails
python generate_puzzle.py --max-attempts 5

# Force a specific medical discipline
python generate_puzzle.py --discipline "Hematology"
python generate_puzzle.py --discipline "Pharmacy"

# Save to custom filename
python generate_puzzle.py --output custom_puzzle.json

# Combine options
python generate_puzzle.py --discipline "Cardiology" --max-attempts 5
```

### **üìÅ Generated Content Location**
- **Live puzzle**: `today.json` (automatically loaded by game)
- **Backups**: `generated_puzzles/` folder (automatic backups of all puzzles)
- **Fallback**: Embedded in `script.js` (works offline)

### **üé≤ Puzzle Categories & Disciplines**
The AI generates different types of medical puzzles:
- **Medical Diagnosis (70%)**: Identify specific conditions (e.g., "Sheehan's Syndrome")
- **Laboratory Test (20%)**: Identify the most appropriate diagnostic test (e.g., "Anti-CCP Antibody")  
- **Drug Adverse Event (10%)**: Identify medication-related complications (e.g., "Vancomycin nephrotoxicity")

**Medical Disciplines** are weighted by frequency (editable in `config.py`):
- Internal Medicine (15%), Cardiology (12%), Emergency Medicine (10%)
- Infectious Disease (8%), Pulmonology (8%), Gastroenterology (7%)
- Nephrology (6%), Neurology (6%), Endocrinology (5%)
- Hematology (5%), Rheumatology (4%), Oncology (4%)
- Critical Care (3%), Psychiatry (2%), **Pharmacy (2%)**
- Dermatology (1%), Ophthalmology (1%), Otolaryngology (1%)

*Pharmacy discipline has 3x higher likelihood of generating adverse drug events*
